# Belly_Button_Biodiversity_Analysis

# Overview

In this challenge we were tasked to create a website to show our analysis on Belly Button Biodiversity study. For this website we used JavaScript and HTML to format the website to the specifications requested. We used the jumbotron banner in the HTML to create an eye-catching tile. We used a laboratory background to symbolize the research that was done for the bacteria found in the test subject belly buttons. The website can easily filter between all the test subjects and it will update each graph based on that specific test subject's results. The bar graph shows the top 10 bacterias found in the test subject. The gauge graph shows the frequency of cleanliness. And the bubble chart compares the bacteries.
